## Assign permission set
To be able to use any Bluace product the permission set LICENSING USER LBLC must be assigned to all users that use one of the products.
This is also the case for Permission Reporting.

Besides that, the permission set PERMISS. REPORT PBLC must be assigned to all users that actually use the accompanied Power BI report.
